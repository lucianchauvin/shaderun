# shaderun
A tool to run `glsl` shaders aimed to streamline the process of creating and
running them. Somewhat compatiable and aimed to replicate [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

## compile
`make`

## running
`Usage: ./shaderun <fragment_path> [window_width] [window_height]`

## WIP
Not sure if the window width and height work yet, my window manager doesnt let
things not be in fullscreen or like maximized to fill a space.
