# shaderun
A tool to interact with `glsl` shaders aimed to streamline the process of
creating and running them. Somewhat compatiable with work done using, and aimed
to replicate, [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

## dependencies
This project requires [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/).

## compile
`make`

## running
Usage: ./shaderun <fragment_path> [window_width] [window_height] [-o <output_file>]

## WIP
Not sure if the window width and height work yet, my window manager doesnt let
things not be in fullscreen or like maximized to fill a space.
